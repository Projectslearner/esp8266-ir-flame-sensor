# ESP8266 IR Flame Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
The ESP8266 IR Flame Sensor project demonstrates how to use an IR flame sensor with an ESP8266 microcontroller to detect the presence of a flame. The sensor detects infrared light emitted by flames and sends signals to the ESP8266, which interprets and displays the detection status on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **IR Flame Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Power Supply**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the IR Flame Sensor:**
   - **Signal Pin:** Connect to GPIO pin D2 on the ESP8266.
   - **VCC:** Connect to a 3.3V or 5V pin on the ESP8266, depending on sensor requirements.
   - **GND:** Connect to a GND pin on the ESP8266 for common ground.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Upload the provided Arduino code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
   - Open the Serial Monitor to view the flame detection status.

2. **Testing:**
   - Ensure the IR flame sensor is correctly positioned and powered.
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for real-time updates on flame detection ("Flame detected!" or "No flame detected.").

#### Applications
- **Fire Detection Systems:** Use in fire alarm systems for early flame detection.
- **Safety Systems:** Integrate into safety devices to alert users to potential fire hazards.
- **Industrial Automation:** Implement in industrial processes to monitor flame presence.

#### Notes
- **Sensor Sensitivity:** Adjust sensor sensitivity as needed to optimize flame detection accuracy.
- **Environmental Considerations:** Place the IR flame sensor away from direct sunlight and other sources of infrared light interference.
- **Power Management:** Ensure stable power supply to the ESP8266 and IR flame sensor for reliable operation.
